I’ll explore how to create an AI agent that takes startup info via an API and returns a full Next.js JSX component that acts as a static pitch deck-style page. I’ll also look into how to integrate this with your existing FastAPI backend using the OpenAI SDK or other tools that might help streamline generation, formatting, and saving of these components.

I’ll get back to you shortly with a plan and recommendations.

# AI-Powered Startup Pitch Deck Page Generation – Implementation Plan

## 1. System Architecture and API Flow

**Frontend–Backend Interaction:** Set up a clear separation between the Next.js frontend and the FastAPI backend. The Next.js app will collect structured startup info (industry, market, idea description, etc.) via a form and send it to FastAPI for processing. The FastAPI service will act as an AI microservice: it receives the data, calls the LLM to generate JSX code, and returns that code to the frontend. This decoupling keeps the Next.js frontend focused on UI, while the Python backend handles AI logic and external API calls.

**API Request Workflow:** When a user submits their startup info on the frontend, Next.js should make an HTTP request to a FastAPI endpoint (e.g. `POST /api/generate_pitch`). This can be done either server-side (in Next.js `getServerSideProps` or an API route) or client-side (using `fetch` or Axios in a React effect). For simplicity and security, a server-side call is often preferred to keep API keys hidden. For example, you might configure Next.js to proxy requests to FastAPI (as in the Next.js FastAPI template, which maps requests under `/api/py/` to the FastAPI service) ([Next.js FastAPI Starter](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-fastapi-starter#:~:text=The%20Python%2FFastAPI%20server%20is%20mapped,api)). In development, Next.js can call FastAPI at `http://localhost:8000` (with CORS enabled if on different domains), or use a rewrite so that calls to `/api/py/...` route internally to FastAPI ([Next.js FastAPI Starter](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-fastapi-starter#:~:text=The%20Python%2FFastAPI%20server%20is%20mapped,api)) ([Next.js FastAPI Starter](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-fastapi-starter#:~:text=Also%2C%20the%20app%2Fapi%20routes%20are,api)). Below is a high-level sequence of events:

1. **User Submits Form:** The user fills out their startup details (name, problem, solution, market, etc.) on a Next.js page and hits submit.  
2. **Next.js Calls FastAPI:** Next.js sends a request to the FastAPI endpoint (e.g., using `fetch('/api/py/generate_pitch', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(data) })`). On Vercel or similar, you can use a rewrite so that Next.js treats this as an internal API call ([Next.js FastAPI Starter](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-fastapi-starter#:~:text=The%20Python%2FFastAPI%20server%20is%20mapped,api)). In local development, it might point to `http://127.0.0.1:8001/generate_pitch` ([Next.js FastAPI Starter](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-fastapi-starter#:~:text=Also%2C%20the%20app%2Fapi%20routes%20are,api)). For example, a Next.js component could do: 

   ```tsx
   const response = await fetch('/api/py/generate_pitch', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
     body: JSON.stringify(startupData)
   });
   const { jsx_code } = await response.json();
   ``` 

   This will send the startup info to FastAPI and await the AI-generated code. (In a streaming setup you could use server-sent events or WebSockets, but here a simple request/response is sufficient.)

3. **FastAPI Processes Request:** The FastAPI endpoint (e.g., `/generate_pitch`) receives the JSON payload. It uses a Pydantic model to validate the input fields (ensuring the info is structured). Then it constructs a prompt for the LLM and calls the OpenAI API (or alternative LLM) to generate the JSX. Once the AI responds, FastAPI returns the JSX code in the response (likely as a JSON field or plain text). 
This isolates all AI logic in the backend.

4. **Next.js Receives JSX Code:** The Next.js frontend (or its API route) receives the JSX code string. Now the app can render this code as a web page. There are a couple of approaches here (discussed more in Section 3): you can treat the response as *content* (e.g. an HTML string to display), or as *code* to be integrated into the Next.js app. A straightforward method is to send back a raw HTML/JSX string and render it using a React component with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (after sanitizing) .Another approach is to save the code as a file or database entry and have Next.js dynamically import or render it. The choice depends on how dynamic and persistent you want the pitch pages to be. For a quick solution, treating the AI output as content to display is easiest.

5. **Render the Pitch Deck Page:** Finally, the JSX/HTML code is presented as a static pitch deck. If using the string approach, you might have a Next.js page like `/pitch/[id].jsx` that fetches the generated code (by pitch ID) and injects it into the DOM. If integrating as real JSX, you might compile it into a React component (which could be more complex). The end result is a nicely formatted, static webpage containing the user’s pitch deck content.

**Example:** Suppose a user enters info for a startup. The Next.js page calls FastAPI and gets back a string of JSX. We can render it like so:

```jsx
// Next.js PitchViewer component
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

export default function PitchViewer({ codeString }) {
  const cleanHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(codeString);  
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: cleanHTML }} />;
}
```

Here we convert the JSX string to safe HTML and inject it. This way, the Next.js app is essentially showing a static page generated by the AI. This pattern (Next.js + FastAPI) is quite common for AI apps – for instance, one can use Next.js as the front-end and FastAPI as a backend for LLM calls, even deploying them together (the Next.js FastAPI starter template maps API routes to a FastAPI server on Vercel) ([Next.js FastAPI Starter](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-fastapi-starter#:~:text=The%20Python%2FFastAPI%20server%20is%20mapped,api)) ([Next.js FastAPI Starter](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-fastapi-starter#:~:text=Also%2C%20the%20app%2Fapi%20routes%20are,api)).

## 2. LLM Selection and JSX Generation Strategy

**Choosing an LLM:** .You can use OpenAI’s SDK via the FastAPI backend to call the model. 

**Prompt Engineering:** The key to high-quality JSX output is in how you prompt the model. You should provide the startup info in a structured way and explicitly ask for a JSX component as output. For example, you could formulate a system or user prompt like:

```
"You are an AI that creates pitch deck web pages in JSX. 
Format: Return a complete React component in valid JSX, with inline styling or Tailwind CSS classes. 
Do not include explanations. 

[Startup Name]: {name}
[Industry]: {industry}
[Market]: {market_details}
[Problem]: {problem_statement}
[Solution]: {solution_description}
[... other fields ...]

Create a responsive one-page pitch deck with sections for the problem, solution, market, etc., using the above details. Use clear headings and styled components. Return only JSX code."
```

This prompt gives the model a template to follow. The model should output something like a functional React component, for example:

```jsx
function PitchDeck() {
  return (
    <div className="pitch-page">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">{/* Startup Name */}TechStartup Inc.</h1>
      <p className="italic text-gray-700">Innovating in Renewable Energy</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>Homeowners struggle with installing solar panels due to ...</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Our AI-driven platform simplifies ...</p>
      </section>
      {/* ...more sections like Market, Team, etc... */}
      <style jsx>{`
        .pitch-page { font-family: sans-serif; padding: 2rem; line-height: 1.6; }
        h1 { margin-bottom: 1rem; }
        section { margin: 2rem 0; }
      `}</style>
    </div>
  );
}
export default PitchDeck;
```

In practice, the model might include the startup info directly in the JSX (as shown above). You can increase reliability by **few-shot prompting** – i.e. provide an example or two of a fake startup and the desired JSX output. This “prompts as programming” approach was used with GPT-3 to autogenerate JSX by giving it sample `<description -> code>` pairs. Few-shot examples help the LLM understand the format precisely and produce more deterministic results.

**Styling considerations:** For a visually appealing result, instruct the AI to use consistent styling. You have a few options:
- *Tailwind CSS classes:* If your Next.js project has Tailwind, the AI can use class names like `"text-red-500 font-bold"`. Models like GPT-4 are aware of common Tailwind classes, as seen in some AI-generated UIs ([How to build: a v0.dev clone (Next.js, GPT4 & CopilotKit) - DEV Community](https://dev.to/evolvedev/how-to-build-a-v0dev-clone-nextjs-gpt4-copilotkit-3co#:~:text=export%20default%20function%20Home%28%29%20,string)). This avoids needing separate CSS and keeps the JSX clean. Just ensure the model knows to use `className` for JSX (or you post-process `class` to `className`).  
- *Inline CSS or styled-jsx:* The model can include a `<style jsx>` block or use inline styles via the `style={{ ... }}` attribute. This ensures the styles are encapsulated in the component. The example above shows a `<style jsx>` usage. Another simple approach is inline styles for each element, though that can get verbose.  
- *Component libraries:* If you have a design system (e.g., Material-UI, Chakra, or custom Next UI components), you could tell the model to use those. However, that requires the model to know your component API. A safer bet is to stick to basic HTML elements with classes, then you can always restyle later.  
- *Responsive design:* Encourage the model to use semantic HTML and maybe simple responsive tricks (like using flexbox or grid classes) so the page looks good on different devices. Keep prompts about responsiveness high-level, as specific CSS might be too detailed for the model.

**LLM Call via API:** Use the OpenAI SDK (or appropriate library) in the FastAPI backend to send the prompt. For example, using OpenAI’s Python SDK:

```python
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[ 
      {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT}, 
      {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt_with_startup_info}
    ],
    temperature=0.3,
    max_tokens=1500
)
code = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
```

A low temperature (e.g. 0.2–0.5) helps the model output more deterministic, template-like code (reducing creative deviations). Set `max_tokens` high enough to cover a full page (depending on how large the pitch content is, 1000-2000 tokens might be needed). If using an open-source model via Transformers, you’d do a similar call by feeding the prompt text and getting the generated text.

**Validating the format:** Sometimes models might return explanations or apologize if not properly instructed. To guard against this, explicitly ask for *code only*. You can also detect if the output contains unwanted parts. For example, if the response contains markdown ```jsx fences or additional commentary, strip those out in post-processing. Utilizing a library like **LangChain** with an output parser can enforce that the output is just code by validating the format. In more advanced setups, tools like **Guardrails AI** or OpenAI’s function calling (with a custom function that expects a string result) can ensure the model adheres to the required JSX format. In practice, a well-crafted prompt with maybe a few-shot example tends to be enough for this use-case.

## 3. Rendering and Safety: Clean, Reusable & Secure Code

Once the AI returns JSX code, we need to integrate it safely into our web app. This step is crucial to ensure the code is **clean (well-formatted and correct JSX), reusable (can be edited or saved), and secure (no injection or unsafe content).**

**Formatting and correctness:** The raw code from the model might have minor issues (e.g., a missed closing tag or the use of `class` instead of `className`). It’s good to post-process the string before rendering:
- Use a **prettier/formatter** for JSX. You can run a tool like Prettier (via an npm script or even an API like prettier’s standalone package) to auto-format the JSX string. This will catch and fix common syntax issues and ensure indentation is nice.
- Optionally, run a simple **lint or parse check**. For example, you could attempt to parse the JSX string with Babel to see if it’s valid. If not, you could have a fallback (maybe send a corrected prompt to the AI or do a minor regex fix for known issues like self-closing `<br>` tags).
- Structure the code as a *function component* returning JSX (as we instructed). This makes it easy to reuse. For instance, if you wanted to not just display it, but actually import it, you could write the string to a `.jsx` file in a certain directory. However, writing files at runtime in Next.js (especially on Vercel) is not straightforward. It’s easier to store in a database.

**Safe rendering (avoiding XSS):** Treat the AI-generated code as **untrusted content** – because it effectively comes from user input (the user’s info could be manipulated, or the AI could insert something unintended). Security best practices for generative content must be applied. The main risk is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) – e.g., the model could accidentally include a `<script>` tag or malicious onclick handler. In fact, OWASP’s guidance on LLM security warns that if you directly render AI output in a browser, it can lead to XSS if not sanitized
- **Sanitize HTML:** Before injecting the generated code into the DOM, use a sanitization library like **DOMPurify** (for browser) or Bleach (for Python, if sanitizing server-side) to remove any disallowed tags or attributes. For example, in React you can do: 

  ```js
  import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
  const cleanHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(aiOutput);
  element.innerHTML = cleanHTML; 
  ``` 

  DOMPurify will strip out things like `<script>` or event handler attributes that could be injected . This is essential when using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` as the method itself doesn’t protect you (hence the “dangerous” name). The Medium example above shows how raw editor HTML is sanitized before insertion, which exactly parallels our case.

- **Output encoding:** Ensure any dynamic data is properly encoded. If the model is just regurgitating the user’s text into JSX, you rely on React to escape it when using curly braces. (E.g., `{startupName}` in JSX will be auto-escaped by React, preventing script injection in those values.) However, if you convert everything to a string of HTML, you lose React’s built-in escaping. That’s why using a sanitizer is important if you go the innerHTML route. Essentially, you need to *encode* the output for the context it’s used in (HTML in this case) 



**Reuse and Maintainability:** The generated JSX represents a *static* pitch deck. You might want to allow users to tweak or save it. Consider storing the AI output in a database record (indexed by a pitch or user ID). Instead of regenerating every time, the Next.js app can fetch the saved JSX/HTML from the database for subsequent loads. This also means if you improve the generation prompt or model, you could regenerate and update the saved version. Moreover, having it in a database allows an admin or developer to manually review or edit the code if needed (to fix styling or remove any inappropriate content the AI might have included).

**Error Handling:** Be prepared for cases where the AI output is not usable JSX. The FastAPI backend should handle exceptions (e.g., OpenAI API errors, or detect if the output is too short or missing something). Return an error message that the frontend can show gracefully (“Sorry, the pitch generation failed. Please try again.”). Logging these errors is important for debugging. If using OpenAI, implement retries or check for rate limit responses as part of robust production use 

**Testing AI Output:** Before deploying, test the agent with a variety of example inputs (different industries, lengths of text, etc.). Make sure the output is consistently formatted. This will help refine your prompt. For example, if you find the AI sometimes outputs raw HTML without JSX, adjust the prompt to emphasize React format. If it sometimes ignores styling, maybe add more instructions or an example with styling. Treat the prompt and output as an iterative design: you may need a few rounds to get the desired consistency. Keep monitoring even after launch – if users input very novel data that confuses the AI, you might get odd output. Having telemetry (logging the prompt and output for errors, with user consent) can help identify and fix such cases.

## 4. Static Hosting and Persistence of Generated Pages

**Dynamic vs Static:** Decide if the pitch pages should be generated on-the-fly for each request or generated once and then served statically. The term “static” here means the content doesn’t change per request (after generation). There are a few ways to handle this:



- **Static Site Generation (SSG) or Export:** If you want these pitch pages to be truly static (no server needed to generate on each request), you can generate and save them. For example, once the AI returns the JSX, FastAPI could also save an HTML file (after rendering the JSX to HTML). You might use a headless browser or ReactDOMServer in Node to turn the JSX string into an HTML string, then store that. The saved HTML could be uploaded to an S3 bucket or stored in your database. Next.js could then serve it as a static file. One way is to have a Next.js dynamic route that checks if a static HTML exists for that pitch ID and if so, just returns it (you might integrate this with Next’s `getStaticPaths`/`getStaticProps` if you know pages ahead of time, but here pages are user-generated on the fly, so it’s more of an **Incremental Static Regeneration** scenario).

- **URL structure and hosting:** Decide how users will access their pitch deck. A common approach is to give each pitch a unique URL (e.g. `yourapp.com/pitch/12345` or perhaps `yourapp.com/u/username/pitch`). When a page is generated, you can respond with that URL so the frontend can redirect the user to view it. If these pages are publicly shareable, having a nice slug (maybe the startup name in the URL) could be nice, but that also means handling slugs collisions or sanitization. For simplicity, an ID or UUID is fine initially.

- **Storage:** Use a persistent store to save the pitch content. A SQL or NoSQL database can store the JSX or HTML string along with metadata (user, title, timestamp). Ensure the column can handle the length (some pitches might be a few thousand characters). Alternatively, you could store the content in an S3 bucket or file storage, especially if you generate an HTML file. Even if you plan to serve statically, a database is useful as the source of truth.

- **Regeneration and updates:** Optionally, allow users to regenerate or update their pitch. Perhaps they can tweak some input and regenerate, or you might allow minor edits on the generated content (like a simple CMS). In that case, if a user edits text, ensure those edits get saved and not overwritten by regeneration unless intended. This moves beyond pure generation into content management, so consider the scope carefully.

## 5. Tools, Libraries, and Best Practices

To implement the above, here’s a summary of recommended tools and practices:

- **FastAPI (Python)** – For the backend API. It’s high-performance and easy to set up asynchronous calls to the AI. Use Pydantic models to define the expected input (e.g., a `StartupIdea` model with fields like `name: str`, `industry: str`, etc.) and for the response if needed. FastAPI will also auto-generate docs for your API which can be handy for testing. Ensure to enable CORS if the frontend is on a different origin (use `fastapi.middleware.cors`).

- **OpenAI SDK / HTTP client** – To call the LLM. With OpenAI, use their official `openai` Python package. For other models, you might use `requests` to call a model server’s REST API or the `transformers` library to run it locally. If using OpenAI, store the API key securely (e.g., in an environment variable) and load it in FastAPI. Also, handle errors: the OpenAI API might occasionally fail or return rate-limit errors, so implement retries or backoff as needed (


- **Prettier or ESLint** – For code formatting. You can integrate a Prettier format step on the returned JSX string. This could be done either in the backend (there are Node services for Prettier, but since FastAPI is Python, you might call an external formatter, or simply send the code to the frontend and format it there using the browser or Node). Even without Prettier, at least strip trailing whitespace and ensure consistent newlines for cleanliness.

- **DOMPurify (frontend)** or **Bleach (backend)** – For sanitizing the HTML. As demonstrated, DOMPurify is a lightweight JS library that you can include in your Next.js project to clean the AI output before rendering 


- **Frontend UX** – Make the generation user-friendly. Call the API via a loading state and inform the user that their pitch is being generated (LLM calls can take a few seconds, especially with GPT-4). Provide feedback or a spinner. Possibly use streaming (OpenAI API can stream tokens) to show the pitch being built in real-time, but that’s a nice-to-have (FastAPI can stream response with . Initially, a simple wait is fine. After generation, show the pitch deck nicely – you might route the user to a new page that displays it, or show it in a modal/preview. Given it’s a full page, probably routing to a dedicated page is best.



- **Diagram/Visualization:** The architecture can be visualized as: **Next.js Frontend** (collects input, displays output) ⟶ **FastAPI Backend** (calls AI) ⟶ **LLM (OpenAI)** which returns JSX code ⟶ back to **FastAPI** ⟶ **Next.js** renders page. The Next.js and FastAPI communicate over an HTTP API boundary 

By following this plan – with a solid API flow, careful prompt design for the LLM, and diligent sanitizing/formatting of the AI-generated JSX – you’ll implement a robust AI-powered pitch deck generator. Each user will be able to get a tailor-made, static pitch page that can be served through your Next.js app. This approach leverages modern best practices for AI integration (using backend for AI calls, treating model output as potentially malicious, caching results, etc.), setting the stage for a reliable and scalable platform. Good luck with your implementation!
